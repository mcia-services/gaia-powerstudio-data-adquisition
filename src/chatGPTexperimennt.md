Here is the equivalent Python code:

Copy code
def build_query_string(params, param_name):
    builder = []
    for param in params:
        builder.append(param_name + "=" + param + "&")
    return "".join(builder)[:-1]
In this code, we are using a list to store the query string parts and then joining them together with "".join(builder) to create the final query string. We are also using string concatenation with + to add the param_name, "=", and param to the query string. Finally, we are removing the last "&" character by using slicing with [:-1].

private URI buildRequestURI(String path, List<String> params, String paramName) {
		try {
			String query = (params == null || paramName == null) ? null : buildQueryString(params, paramName);
			return new URI("http", null, host, port, path, query, null);
		} catch (URISyntaxException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
			throw new RuntimeException("Could not build Request URI for path: " + path + " with query params: " + params, e);
		}
	}
Here is the equivalent Python code:

Copy code
from urllib.parse import urlencode, quote
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen

def build_request_uri(path, params, param_name):
    try:
        if params is None or param_name is None:
            query = None
        else:
            query = build_query_string(params, param_name)
        
        url = "http://{host}:{port}{path}?{query}".format(
            host=host, port=port, path=path, query=query
        )
        
        return url
    except Exception as e:
        e.print_stacktrace()
        raise RuntimeError("Could not build Request URI for path: " + path + " with query params: " + params, e)
In this code, we are using the urlencode() function from the urllib.parse module to encode the query string parameters. Then, we are using string formatting to create the final URL with the host, port, path, and query values. Note that we are using the quote() function from the urllib.parse module to properly encode the path and query values. We are also using the urllib.request module to create a Request object and send it using the urlopen() function.

Finally, we are catching any exceptions that may be raised and printing the stack trace with e.print_stacktrace(). We are also raising a RuntimeError with a custom error message to indicate that the request URI could not be built.

private <T> List<List<T>> chop(List<T> list, int size) {
		if (size < 2) {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("Chop size cannot be lower than 2");
		}
		List<List<T>> parts = new ArrayList<List<T>>();
		int N = list.size();
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i += size) {
			parts.add(new ArrayList<T>(list.subList(i, Math.min(N, i + size))));
		}
		return parts;
	}
Here is the equivalent Python code:

Copy code
def chop(list, size):
    if size < 2:
        raise ValueError("Chop size cannot be lower than 2")
    parts = []
    N = len(list)
    for i in range(0, N, size):
        parts.append(list[i:min(N, i + size)])
    return parts
In this code, we are using a for loop to iterate over the input list in steps of size. At each step, we are adding a new list object containing the elements from i to min(N, i + size) to the parts list. Then, we are returning the parts list as the result of the chop() function.

Note that we are using the len() function to get the length of the input list, and we are using min() to get the minimum of N and i + size. We are also raising a ValueError if the size argument is lower than 2.


Here is the equivalent code in Python:

Copy code
def get_available_tags():
    # Get all the devices
    devices = rest.get_for_object(devices_uri, Devices)
    if (devices is None or devices.get_ids() is None or devices.get_ids().is_empty()):
        return []
    device_ids = devices.get_ids()
    logger.debug("Found {} devices", len(device_ids))

    # Get the variables from all the devices, in packs
    packs = chop(device_ids, DISCOVER_VARS_BATCH_SIZE)
    variable_ids = []
    for pack in packs:
        variables_uri = build_request_uri(VARIABLES_PATH, pack, DEVICES_PARAM_NAME)
        variables = rest.get_for_object(variables_uri, Variables)
        if (variables is not None and variables.get_variables() is not None):
            new_var_ids = [var.get_id() for var in variables.get_variables()]
            variable_ids.extend(new_var_ids)
            logger.debug("Found {} variables for this pack", len(new_var_ids))
        else:
            logger.warn("Found 0 variables for this pack")
        time.sleep(0.2)
    return variable_ids
